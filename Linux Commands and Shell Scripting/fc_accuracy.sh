# Create a script to report historical forecasting accuracy
# this script will compare the forecasted temperature for a given day to the actual temperature that was observed
# requires the use of the rx_poc.log file and at least two entry rows in that log
# it is part of the practice project in the Linux Commands and Shell Scripting IBM course

# obtain the weather information for casablanca
city_name=casablanca # assign city name to variable
curl wttr.in/$city_name?T --output weather_report # insert variable into curl command and output into file

#echo "Here is the actual temperature for today at noon as loaded into a variable using curl and grep commands: $act_temp"

# below we get the temp that was forecasted for today, as input into our rx_poc.log file
# use the tail command to get the most recent line to use for the forecast
# then pipe to cut to get the final column of the row using tab delimiter

# the last line in rx_poc.log will give us the observed temperature for the day
# the second to last line will give us the forecasted temperature for today at noon
# first we start with the forecast yesterday
# take the 2nd to last line for the forecasted temperature for today
